%costs, future work

In conclusion, the go-kart fulfils it's requirements. 
With more time on our hands, we could have planned the project better. There were many unforeseen expenses, which mainly resulted from compatibility issues. 
Especially dSpace's CANOpen Master Solution led to a lot of issues. While it provided a somehow intuitive interface and helped in creating the needed blocks, it also lacked customisability. Many processes were somehow a black box model. This made debugging and understanding the errors very challenging or even impossible. The lack of documentation and support did not help either.
